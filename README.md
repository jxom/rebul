# [Rebul](https://rebul.now.sh)

> React UI Component Library built with the [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io/)

## Installation

```
npm install rebul bulma
```

## Basic usage

Rebul does not depend on Bulma's stylesheets as we don't want to restrict you to any one version, hence you will have to import it yourself.

```jsx
import 'bulma/css/bulma.css';

import Button from 'rebul/lib/Button'; // or: import { Button } from 'rebul';

export default () => <Button color="primary">Hello world</Button>
```

## Documentation

## Developing

You can easily develop Rebul components locally by running a local instance of our docs:

```
git clone https://github.com/jxom/rebul.git
cd rebul
npm install
npm run catalog-start
```

then navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
